## 💡 Projects

### 🔹 [Libft](https://github.com/anasamellahe/libft)
**Language**: C  
A custom C library that recreates many standard C library functions, like `strlen()`, `strlcpy()`, `calloc()`, and more. This foundational project helped me understand the inner workings of C functions and memory management.

### 🔹 [ft_printf](https://github.com/anasamellahe/ft_printf)
**Language**: C  
An implementation of the C `printf` function. It was a great challenge to handle various format specifiers and flags while ensuring flexibility and precision.

### 🔹 [get_next_line](https://github.com/anasamellahe/get_next_line)
**Language**: C  
A function that reads a line from a file descriptor. I learned about dynamic memory management and handling buffers to efficiently read large amounts of data.

### 🔹 [Born2beroot](https://github.com/anasamellahe/born2beroot)
**Language**: Shell/Virtualization  
A system administration project where I set up a virtual machine and learned about managing users, processes, and security policies. This introduced me to the world of Linux administration and basic networking concepts.

### 🔹 [pipex](https://github.com/anasamellahe/pipex)
**Language**: C  
A small program that mimics the shell pipeline (`|`). I learned how to handle multiple processes, redirecting input/output, and working with pipes to pass data between commands.

### 🔹 [push_swap](https://github.com/anasamellahe/push_swap)
**Language**: C  
An algorithmic project that sorts a stack of integers with the minimum number of moves using a set of predefined operations. It strengthened my understanding of sorting algorithms and optimization techniques.

### 🔹 [Philosopher](https://github.com/anasamellahe/philosopher)
**Language**: C  
A project based on the "Dining Philosophers" problem, where I dealt with thread management, mutexes, and solving concurrency issues in C. It was an interesting dive into multithreading and synchronization.

### 🔹 [Minishell](https://github.com/anasamellahe/minishell)
**Language**: C  
A shell implementation that mimics the behavior of Bash. It involved handling command parsing, file descriptors, process management, and implementing built-in commands like `cd`, `echo`, and `export`.
